First, t-SNE constructs a probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in such a way that similar objects have a high probability of being picked, whilst dissimilar points have an extremely small probability of being picked. Second, t-SNE defines a similar probability distribution over the points in the low-dimensional map, and it minimises the [Kullback–Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) between the two distributions with respect to the locations of the points in the map.

    "**Term frequency (tf)** measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear far more often in long documents than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is often divided by the document length (a.k.a. the total number of terms in the document) as a way of normalisation: \n",

    "TF($t$) = (Number of times term $t$ appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document).\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>(This is the relative frequency of each term in a document)</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inverse document frequency (idf)** measures how important a term is. While computing tf, all terms are considered equally important. However, it is known that certain terms, such as \"is\", \"of\", and \"that\", may appear many times but have little importance. Thus, we need to down-weight the frequent terms while up-weighting the rare ones, by computing the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "IDF($t$) = ln(Total number of documents / Number of documents containing term $t$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**tf–idf** is the product of the values of **tf** and **idf**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**An example**\n",
    "> Consider a document containing 100 words wherein the word \"cat\" appears three times. The term frequency (i.e. tf) for \"cat\" is then (3 / 100) = 0.03. Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word \"cat\" appears in one thousand of these. Then, the inverse document frequency (i.e. idf) is calculated as ln(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4. Thus, the tf–idf weight is the product of these quantities: 0.03 * 4 = 0.12.\n",
